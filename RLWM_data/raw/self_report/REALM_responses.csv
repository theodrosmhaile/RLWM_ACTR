5/8/2019 17:56:04,28305,5/8/2019,"It was a bit dull but I'm competitive so I made a game out of it. I gave each picture a name and would say the name in my head when the image came up. I could tell that in the trials with 6 images, each key would have two images. Once I figured out which was which, I paired them in my head and that helped me remember them. ","I thought they were kind of cute, they seemed like the cartoons my parents my have watched as kids. I wasn't exactly sure what constituted a scene change, so I may have over pressed the space bar. ",I think I remembered them fairly well. It came pretty easily becasue I'd seen them all before. ,"There were a couple of times in each phase where my mind wondered, but I always brought it back fairly quickly.",nope!
5/9/2019 9:59:50,28230,5/9/2019,"The first phase of the experiment was confusing, almost a little cryptic, at first, but over time I learned to adjust and get into the right ""mindset"" for it. The only strategy I used was memorizing the images presented at the beginning of the block, and then saying the names of the images whenever I figured out which key resulted in points. When there were 6 instead of 3 pictures, I grouped the pairs of images together by thinking of a common similarity for each pair.","I feel as if the instructions were too vague and I was mostly unsure of what I was supposed to be looking for, as well as if I was segmenting the videos correctly.","I remembered all of the images in the last phase, and I was surprised at how easily the keys for some of them came back to me. ","I felt most engaged in the first halves of the first and last phases, somewhat engaged in the second halves of the same phases, and only slightly engaged during the second phase.",N/A
5/10/2019 11:54:30,28307,5/10/2019,"I recall that if there were 6 pictures in that round, the pictures go in ""twos"" so the first and second pictures always had the same answer, 3rd and 4th had the same answer, and 5th and 6th pictures had the same answer. ",I wasn't exactly sure how to segment each video. In the first video I segmented a lot and very few times throughout the 2nd and 3rd. ,"I think there were some rounds that I was able to recall and get most of them correct, and other sets of pictures that I had no recollection of which was which. ",It varied! Mental fatigue sets in about 25 minutes into the experiment and it's challenging to stay engaged throughout. ,N/A
5/10/2019 16:21:57,28241,5/10/2019,"I tried to draw similarities between images that had the same answer to help me remember. For example, for one of the blocks the palm tree and the evergreen tree were both V so I remembered tree = V","I thought the episodes were kind of weird and I wasn't sure exactly what ""new"" meant",There were some images I remembered much better than others. I think the images from the blocks that were harder for me were the ones I remembered better.,I felt more engaged during the first and last parts than the middle part with the episodes.,I thought these tasks were challenging and it was fun for me to see how well I could do.
5/13/2019 15:28:18,28243,5/13/2019,"I approached each block the same way. Each block would run through each image once before rotating through in a random order. I would first check to see if each image worked with the 'c' key first, then the following round I would test the unknown images with the 'v' key, and if that didn't work I would use the 'b' key when the remaining images showed up. I would do my best to use some aspect of the image to categorize them if there were more than just three images present. ","I was kind of confused. There was no apparent feedback, so I wasn't really sure what I was doing. It was kind of up to my discretion to determine what I thought was a segment. In the beginning I think I made more segments than needed because I was unsure of what a segment was in the context of the movie.",I thought I did a pretty good job of remembering the images. I thought my ability to recall the blocks that utilized all three keys was a lot stronger than the blocks that only used two keys. ,I felt decently engaged in the first phase. I think the length of some of the blocks may have affected my engagement. I didn't feel too engaged with the second phase because there was no feedback/scoring system. I felt the most engaged in the last phase because everything was familiar and for some reason it felt more high stakes/challenging which increased my engagement.,I think a more thorough explanation of phase two would be helpful. I am still unsure the purpose of it towards this study.
5/14/2019 14:51:21,28220,5/14/2019,"I could limit the answers to two buttons or certain characteristics. For example, on the fruit block I found that the third button contained only apples (pineapple and apple).",It was kind of boring and I didn't really understand what I was doing.,Very well. Only made easy mistakes and I also forgot the blocks about rooms in the house and environments.,"Engaged in the first and third, not the second.",No additional comments.
5/15/2019 16:51:05,28215,5/15/2019,"The main strategy I used was using color to group things quickly. It was also easier to remember groups if they had similar shape or theme (ie yellow and purple were together and those remind me of UW). Once I learned them, I just repeated their names in my head when I saw the image.","I don't think I completely understood the instructions. I started out by segmenting it every time something changed on the screen, but then after a while I thought I should maybe change to more thematic sections?","For everything except the shapes section, I think I remembered them pretty well! For some reason I could not get the shapes down at all.","I was pretty bored during the middle section and might have zoned out, but during the first and third parts I was very engaged.",Nope! :)
5/15/2019 17:49:22,28310,5/15/2019,"Yes I guessed C first for every image until there were two images that I knew were C and then I went to V, same strategy guessed until I knew there where two images and then moved on to B",I thought that it was just a distraction to give me time between the other phases. I couldn't find any pattern to the segments and was just trying to end the segment when the characters left the page. ,Decently well. There were some that I wasn't sure of and others that I just messed up and knew I got it wrong right after I hit the button. ,The first and third I felt very engaged. The second one I didn't feel very engaged. ,None
11/8/2019 16:01:24,15000,11/8/2019,It was easier to get more right when there was only 3 images but it was easier to remember the 6 images when asked during the recall phase.,"not really, it was pretty boring",I feel i did decently. It was definitly easier to remember the sets 6 because my gingers didn't have to remember which button wasn't being used.,the cvb one wasn't super engaging and the videos were pretty boring but the others were kinda fun,"overall, this was a good experience and i wouldn't mind coming back in for something maybe a little shorter."
11/8/2019 18:20:18,15001,11/8/2019,"I named every image, and if there are two images are associated with one key, I will make them in a group.",I focused on them constantly because they are interssting.,I think I remember most of them.,I feel a little tired to deal with them constantly because I need to pay attention to them completely.,"It is hard to balance solving problems and memorize things, so I think I used different part of my brain to operate these work at the same time."
11/13/2019 12:07:04,15002,11/13/2019,i thought that phase was the hardest one. I would try to keep pressing one key to figure out what key was right for the picture.,"No, i blanked on most of it because of the previous activity.",Not well enough.,I felt tired as the material was longer. Towards the end i was shocked that we had to remember everything taht caught my attention.,Nothing! It was great. 
11/13/2019 15:30:06,15003,11/13/2019,I learned the images by associating them with the colors most vibrant in the photos. ,It did not keep my attention very well. I found myself becoming spaced out ,not very well,very engaged ,nope

11/15/2019 11:58:11,15007,11/15/2019,"I do collect some images into a section with a ""name"" so it will be easier to remember. ",The animated videos did take my attention and it also somehow distract my earlier memory about the keys and images.  ,"Not too bad but also not good, forgetting the exact key that relate to the pictures. ",somehow. ,It is a pretty long and repeating tasks. But it make sense when I am meeting some trouble when I tried to remember the letter when math problems or sentences come up with the letters together. 
11/15/2019 15:23:18,15008,11/15/2019,I grouped the images and then applied them each key.,"At the beginning, I may have segmented the episodes a little too short. It did keep my attention.",Surprisingly well. ,I felt very engaged throughout the whole experiment.,No

11/20/2019 15:47:57,15012,11/20/2019,"Yes, my method was to connect each picture to one word. the red smudge would be red, the picture with the forest would be forest. Then I would try to see which one of the pictures belonged to c, after i associated the pictures with c, i moved on to test v, and i knew the pictures that weren't c and v had to belong to b. Using one word to associate the picture made it much easier, i tend to use simple words as well. ","The videos were entertaining and I had to click space bar whenever i thought something was going to happen. I thought the instructions was kind of weird but in hindsight the spacebar clicking was probably meant for me to stay focused on the video. Of course the video required less focus and attention than the tasks, but i didn't get distracted or tired while watching it.","i think i remembered them pretty well, however, what i find was happening to me is after a long sequence of pressing a certain letter, i felt the need to press another different one instinctively. For instance, after pressing b like 3 times i felt the need to press c or v, as a result, i acted before i could think and accidentally clicked the wrong answer due to reflex. I felt like i could have done much better.","i feel like i was engaged for pretty much the whole experiment, this is because it requires a certain amount of concentration to memorize things, do math, associate pictures etc, I found that the ones that state I couldn't get below 85% made me focus harder. This is because it felt like a test that I didn't want to do poorly in. With that being said, the segment of videos was the most relaxing part as there was no pressure on me to do things correctly.","If it helps I am dominant with my right hand but used my left hand for the association activities, this is because my right hand was on the mouse. Also the scanner equipment wasn't functioning when I took this experiment. "
11/20/2019 17:38:43,15013,11/20/2019,"In cases when the images shared certain traits such as color, I would link them in my mind. I also made sure to link the letter with the image in my head.","I did keep my attention but I think my consistency was what ""different"" was changed over the course of the videos.",I think I did pretty good considering there were many images that were presented to me.,"I felt strongly engaged as I needed to be focused in order to memorize the shapes, letters and so on.",No
11/21/2019 17:48:45,15014,11/21/2019,"As a strategy, I would try to find correlations between the images paired with each key and each other. For example in one of the sections, cool colors would be paired together and warm colors would be paired together and then colors made from mixes of more than one color would be paired together.","It was kind of confusing thinking about what would separate scenes, but it did keep me engaged with the episodes.

11/26/2019 15:49:07,15020,11/26/2019,The technique I used was choosing the same key for all images in the first round to know which ones are and not associated with the first key.

It wasn't very engaging and it was difficult and not rewarded to decipher what an ""episode"" really was. Very compelling to stare off into space.","I remembered them decently well (I would estimate around 85%) at first, but the longer I continued it felt like the more I lost the procedural memory from the initial associations that I had built up.",I felt most engaged with the multi-tasking/memorizing of the letter recall phases but they were the most mentally taxing.,No thank you.
11/27/2019 15:30:17,15023,11/27/2019,The hardest part was figuring out what key went with what image.
