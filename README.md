## Implementation of RLWM task (Collins and Frank) in ACT-R

### MODEL 1: Simple RL model
This model relies on two parameters - learning rate and *temperature*. Responses are selected based on reward outcome. 
### MODEL 2: Memory based model without RL
This model relies on 'memory' of previous experience of the state and its associated outcome. 
### Model 3: Working memory model without RL
